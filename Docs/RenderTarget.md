# RenderTarget {#RenderTarget}

Defines a render target for rendering to texture. To make the render target active for rendering, use the @ref SetRenderTarget component.

@note This feature needs a graphic card that supports FBOs (GL_EXT_framebuffer_object OpenGL extension). If your card does not support this then ZGE designer will display a message in the log on start up. Also note that each RenderTarget takes up a fair amount of video memory so don't use too many instances.

Example usage: "RenderTarget1" in @ref RenderTexture sample project.
