# Music {#Music}

Represents a imported MIDI music file (*.mid) that can be played in your application using the @ref MusicControl component.

@note The midi-functionality in ZGE is very limited. A better approach is to play music using external libraries, such as, BASS, SunVox or MikMod.

Example usage: see the included project @ref ModPlay for an example.
