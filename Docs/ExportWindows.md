# Generate Executable for Windows {#ExportWindows}

This "HOW TO" describes how to make Windows executable and/or screensaver file
from ZGameEditor project.

## Generate Executable

1. Start ZGameEditor.

2. Open the project file (\*.zgeproj).

3. If you want to create just uncompressed EXE file, press the "Run" button in
   the toolbar or press F9 key.

4. There are also other options, select one of the following menu items:

- "Project / Build and compress Windows exe-file" to generate a compressed EXE
  file. Use this option for producing releases of your applications.

- "Project / Build Screensaver" to generate uncompressed version of Windows
  screen saver; the \*.scr file.

- "Project / Build and compress Screensaver" to generate compressed version of
  Windows screen saver; the \*.scr file. Use this option for producing releases
  of your screensaver.

The generated executable (EXE or SCR) file is placed in the same directory as
the project file.

@note It is recommended to check the "Project / Remove unused code" menu item
which can reduce size of the generated file.

## Compression Settings

To reduce the size of the generated Windows executable file, you can apply UPX
or kkrunchy compression to the generated EXE/SCR file. The final executable is
automatically uncompressed and loaded to memory when executed.

@note To use kkrunchy, you should first manually copy the kkrunchy.exe file to
the &lt;ZGameEditor installdir&gt;/Tools directory. You can download it from
[kkrunchy homepage (external link)](http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/kkrunchy/). UPX
executable is included in the ZGameEditor's distribution.

To customize compression options, use the "Packer settings" section of the
Settings dialog accessible from the "Tools / Settings..." menu item:

You can select from several presets, or you can also specify your own command
line options. See the manual pages for
[UPX (external link)](https://github.com/korczis/upx/blob/master/doc/upx.pod) or
[kkrunchy (external link)](http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/kkrunchy/) for details.

## Setting Application Properties

The @ref ZApplication component (the top-most component in project) defines
several properties that you can use to set appearance and behavior of the
generated executable; namely:

- @ref ZApplicationCaption "Caption"
- @ref ZApplicationFullScreen "FullScreen"
- @ref ZApplicationScreenMode "ScreenMode"
- @ref ZApplicationShowOptionsDialog "ShowOptionsDialog"
- @ref ZApplicationCustomScreenWidthHeight "CustomScreenWidth,
  CustonScreenHeight"
- @ref ZApplicationViewportRatio "ViewportRatio"
- @ref ZApplicationCustomViewportRatio "CustomViewportRatio"
- @ref ZApplicationMouseVisible "MouseVisible"
- @ref ZApplicationEscapeToQuit "EscapeToQuit"
- @ref ZApplicationIcon "Icon"

## Command Line Switches

Generated Windows executable file recognizes the following command line
switches:

| Option | Semantics             |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| -f     | force fullscreen mode |
| -w     | force windowed mode   |
| -s     | disable sound         |

@note Do not use "-f", "-w", and "-s" as part of the project file name (and
therefore also the generated executable file) or part of the directory path to
the executable file, because ZGameEditor would interpret it as a command line
switch. For instance, "u-f-o-s.exe" is not a good file name for a windowed
application with sounds.
